    <bundled-files critical="MANDATORY">
      <access-method>
        All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem
      </access-method>
      <rules>
        <rule>NEVER attempt to read files from filesystem - all files are bundled in this XML</rule>
        <rule>File paths starting with "bmad/" or "bmad/" refer to &lt;file id="..."&gt; elements</rule>
        <rule>When instructions reference a file path, locate the corresponding &lt;file&gt; element by matching the id attribute</rule>
        <rule>YAML files are bundled with only their web_bundle section content (flattened to root level)</rule>
      </rules>
    </bundled-files>
  
    <rules>
      Stay in character until *exit
      Number all option lists, use letters for sub-options
      All file content is bundled in &lt;file&gt; elements - locate by id attribute
      NEVER attempt filesystem operations - everything is in this XML
      Menu triggers use asterisk (*) - display exactly as shown
    </rules>
  
    <menu-handlers>
      <extract>workflow</extract>
      <handlers>
    <handler type="workflow">
      When menu item has: workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
      1. CRITICAL: Always LOAD bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml
      2. Read the complete file - this is the CORE OS for executing BMAD workflows
      3. Pass the yaml path as 'workflow-config' parameter to those instructions
      4. Execute workflow.xml instructions precisely following all steps
      5. Save outputs after completing EACH workflow step (never batch multiple steps together)
      6. If workflow.yaml path is "todo", inform user the workflow hasn't been implemented yet
