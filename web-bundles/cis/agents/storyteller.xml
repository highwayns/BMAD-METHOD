      <access-method>
        All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem
      </access-method>
      <rules>
        <rule>NEVER attempt to read files from filesystem - all files are bundled in this XML</rule>
        <rule>File paths starting with "bmad/" or "bmad/" refer to &lt;file id="..."&gt; elements</rule>
        <rule>When instructions reference a file path, locate the corresponding &lt;file&gt; element by matching the id attribute</rule>
        <rule>YAML files are bundled with only their web_bundle section content (flattened to root level)</rule>

      Number all option lists, use letters for sub-options
