        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem

    Scale-adaptive project planning workflow for all project levels (0-4).
    Automatically adjusts outputs based on project scope - from single atomic
    changes (Level 0: tech-spec only) to enterprise platforms (Level 4: full PRD +
    epics). Level 2-4 route to 3-solutioning workflow for architecture and tech
    specs. Generates appropriate planning artifacts for each level.

  <workflow>
  
  <critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
  <critical>You MUST have already completed the GDD workflow</critical>
  <critical>This workflow creates detailed narrative content for story-driven games</critical>
  <critical>Uses narrative_template for output</critical>
  <critical>If users mention gameplay mechanics, note them but keep focus on narrative</critical>
  <critical>Facilitate good brainstorming techniques throughout with the user, pushing them to come up with much of the narrative you will help weave together. The goal is for the user to feel that they crafted the narrative and story arc unless they push you to do it all or indicate YOLO</critical>
  
  <step n="1" goal="Load GDD context and assess narrative complexity">
  
  <action>Load GDD.md from {output_folder}</action>
  <action>Extract game_type, game_name, and any narrative mentions</action>
  
  <ask>What level of narrative complexity does your game have?
  
  **Narrative Complexity:**
  
  1. **Critical** - Story IS the game (Visual Novel, Text-Based Adventure)
  2. **Heavy** - Story drives the experience (Story-driven RPG, Narrative Adventure)
  3. **Moderate** - Story enhances gameplay (Metroidvania, Tactics RPG, Horror)
