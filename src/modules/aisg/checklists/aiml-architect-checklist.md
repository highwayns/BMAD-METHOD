# AI/ML Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the ML Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before ML system implementation. The ML Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the ML architecture is robust, scalable, performant, and aligned with business requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. ml-architecture.md - The primary ML architecture document (check docs/ml-architecture.md)
2. data-architecture.md - Data pipeline and storage architecture (check docs/data-architecture.md)
3. mlops-architecture.md - MLOps and deployment architecture (check docs/mlops-architecture.md)
4. Business requirements document for alignment validation
5. Performance requirements and SLAs
6. Platform and infrastructure specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

ML PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the ML project type by checking:
- Is this a traditional ML, deep learning, or LLM/RAG project?
- What are the deployment targets (cloud, edge, mobile)?
- What are the performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (PDPA, IMDA, MAS)?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:
1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Performance Focus - Consider inference latency, training time, and resource utilization for every architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:
- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]
