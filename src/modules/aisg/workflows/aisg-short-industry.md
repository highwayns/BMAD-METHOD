## Advantages of SIP Model

1. **Speed**: 50% faster than traditional MVP
2. **Focus**: No training distractions
3. **Quality**: Senior engineers throughout
4. **Cost-Effective**: Smaller team, shorter duration
5. **Lower Risk**: Experienced team reduces unknowns

## When to Choose SIP

Choose SIP when:
- Timeline is critical (3 months max)
- Budget is constrained
- Scope is well-defined
- Data is ready and clean
- No training requirement
- Need production MVP (not POC)

Don't choose SIP when:
- Need to train junior staff
- Scope is unclear or large
- Only need feasibility study (use POC)
- Have 6+ months (use full MVP)
- Complex integration requirements

## Success Stories Template

Track and document:
- Problem solved
- Time to deployment
- Performance achieved
- Lessons learned
- Reusable components
- Client feedback

---

## Notes

- SIP is ideal for companies needing quick AI solutions without the training component
- Focus on delivering a working MVP that can be enhanced later
- Emphasize reusability and documentation for future expansion
- Consider transition to full MVP program if successful
